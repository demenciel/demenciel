# 👋 Welcome to Alexandre's GitHub!

🌟 **Innovative Full Stack Developer | CTO & Co-Founder | Aspiring Combat Engineer** 🌟

### About Me
I'm Alexandre, a software engineer with a completed curriculum at 42 Québec. I co-founded and currently serve as the CTO of 'Imperfect,' a unique dating app where we use React Native and Laravel to enhance user interactions. Additionally, I am self-employed and currently developing 'Weedlogger,' a tool that revolutionizes inventory tracking and management using React.js and Laravel.

🪖 Recently, I've embarked on an exciting journey with the Canadian Armed Forces, training to become a Combat Engineer. This role is teaching me a great deal about discipline and enhancing my problem-solving skills in high-pressure environments.
