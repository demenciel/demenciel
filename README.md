### About Me
I'm Alexandre, currently mastering advanced technologies at [42 Québec](https://www.42quebec.com/). I co-founded and currently serve as the CTO of a unique dating app, 'Imperfect,' where we use React Native and Laravel to enhance user interactions. Additionally, I develop 'Weedlogger' for Roxton Air, a tool that revolutionizes inventory tracking with React.js and Laravel.

🪖 Recently, I've embarked on an exciting journey with the Canadian Armed Forces, training to become a Combat Engineer. This role is teaching me a great deal about discipline and enhancing my problem-solving skills in high-pressure environments.
